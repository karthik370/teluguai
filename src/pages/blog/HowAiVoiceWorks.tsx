          <p className="heading-desc" style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>Have you ever wondered how our AI can listen to your words and respond with a natural-sounding Telugu voice? It's not magic, but a symphony of cutting-edge technologies working in perfect harmony. Let's pull back the curtain and take a deep dive into the technical marvels that give our AI its voice.</p>

          <h2 className="section-title">Step 1: Listening with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)</h2>
          <p>The conversation begins when you tap the microphone. Your voice, an analog sound wave, is captured and instantly digitized. This digital audio is then streamed to an <strong className="text-white">Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)</strong> model. The ASR's job is to transcribe your spoken words into written text. It's like having a super-fast typist who knows Telugu and English, capable of understanding different accents and speaking styles.</p>

          <h2 className="section-title">Step 2: Understanding with Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>
          <p>Once your speech is converted to text, it's sent to the AI's 'brain'—a powerful <strong className="text-white">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> model, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. This is where the real intelligence happens. The NLP model doesn't just read the words; it analyzes grammar, context, and intent to understand what you're truly asking. It also considers the 'Personality' you've selected (e.g., Romantic, Sarcastic) to formulate a response that is not only accurate but also in character.</p>

          <h2 className="section-title">Step 3: Speaking with Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis</h2>
          <p>After the AI has decided what to say, its response exists only as text. To give it a voice, we use a <strong className="text-white">Text-to-Speech (TTS)</strong> engine. Our platform leverages Google Cloud's state-of-the-art TTS service, which is renowned for its high-fidelity, natural-sounding voices. The TTS engine takes the AI's text response, considers your selected voice gender (male or female), and synthesizes a corresponding audio file in Telugu. This process, called synthesis, involves complex models that generate human-like speech patterns, intonation, and rhythm.</p>

          <h2 className="section-title">The Final Symphony</h2>
          <p>The newly created audio file is then streamed back to your device and played through your speakers. This entire round trip—from you speaking to the AI responding—happens in just a few seconds, creating the illusion of a seamless, real-time conversation. It's a complex dance of ASR, NLP, and TTS, all working together to create a simple, intuitive, and magical user experience.</p>
