              Telugu AI Voice Chat is a powerful tool for language practice, learning, and daily communication. Here are some expert tips to help you get the most out of every conversation with your AI assistant.
            </p>

            <h2 className="section-title">1. Speak Clearly and Naturally</h2>
            <p>
              The AI understands natural Telugu speech, so relax and speak as you would with a friend. If the AI mishears you, try rephrasing or speaking a bit slower.
            </p>

            <h2 className="section-title">2. Use the Personality Feature</h2>
            <p>
              Experiment with different AI personalities (Default, Romantic, Sarcastic, Storyteller, Unhinged) to get varied responses and practice different styles of conversation. Each personality brings a unique flavor to your chat.

              <div style={{ minHeight: '250px' }}>{/* AdSense ad placeholder */}</div>
            </div>

            <h2 className="section-title">3. Try Both Voice and Text Input</h2>
            <p>
              Use your voice for a more natural experience, or type your questions if you’re in a noisy environment. The AI is equally responsive to both methods.
            </p>

            <h2 className="section-title">4. Practice Regularly</h2>
            <p>
              Consistency is key to language mastery. Set aside a few minutes each day to chat with the AI, ask questions, or just have fun conversations.
            </p>

            <h2 className="section-title">5. Don’t Be Afraid to Make Mistakes</h2>
            <p>
              The AI is here to help, not judge! Mistakes are a natural part of learning. Use them as opportunities to improve your Telugu skills.
            </p>

            <h2 className="section-title">6. Explore Advanced Features</h2>
            <p>
              Try switching between male and female voices, ask for translations, or request the AI to tell a story or joke. The more you explore, the more you’ll discover!
            </p>

              With these tips, you’ll become a Telugu AI Voice Chat pro in no time. Happy chatting!
