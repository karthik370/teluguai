              AI voice technology serves as a digital bridge connecting diaspora communities to their Telugu roots. Through interactive conversations, storytelling, and cultural exchanges, individuals can maintain fluency in their mother tongue while sharing traditions with younger generations who may be more comfortable with English or other local languages.

              One of the most significant challenges faced by Telugu diaspora families is maintaining language continuity across generations.
